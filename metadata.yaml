description: "Vivian Grey is Benjamin Disraeli's first novel, published by Henry Colburn\
  \ in 1826. Originally published anonymously, ostensibly by a so-called \"man of\
  \ fashion,\" part 1 caused a considerable sensation in London society. Contemporary\
  \ reviewers, suspicious of the numerous solecisms contained within the text, eventually\
  \ identified the young Disraeli (who did not move in high society) as the author.\
  \ Disraeli continued the tale in a second volume, also of 1826, and three subsequent\
  \ volumes in 1827. The form in which Vivian Grey is published now is the revised\
  \ 1853 edition, which was severely expurgated and, according to critic Wendy Burton,\
  \ lost much of the charm and freshness of the 1826 edition. The book is a frequent\
  \ touchstone for discussions of Disraeli's political and literary career.\n From\
  \ Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
